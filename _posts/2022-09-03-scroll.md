After running this blog with Jekyll and github-pages for over two years, I ran into [Scroll](https://scroll.pub/) and fell in love with the newspaper-y style and minimalist setup, so I wanted to try it out.

# Getting started
Scroll is a easy to install as
```
npm install -g scroll-cli
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/breck7/scroll
cd scroll
npm install -g .
```
 and then running `scroll init` inside the blog directory. After that I converted all posts to `.scroll` files and pushed them to a separate [branch](https://github.com/charlottemach/charlottemach.github.io/tree/scroll).

# Changes

The structure changes a bit, with all files in a flat structure (aside from images, those can stay in a subfolder).
For the previous markdown in my posts I just added the [markups.scroll](https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/public/blog/markups.scroll) to avoid too much rewriting.
There are a few features that would go away with the switch, namely analytics and tagged pages. Though tagging seems to be replaceable with categories and I might have found a way to add the javascript to each page.

# Running locally
For local rendering, it's now `scroll watch` instead of `jekyll -s`, though you can also run `scroll build` and open the `.html` files in your browser directly.

# Github Pages

## Comparison

It gives the site a different feel, but while I do really like the look of it I'm sticking with the Jekyll version for now, mostly for the Markdown and out of the box analytics support.
